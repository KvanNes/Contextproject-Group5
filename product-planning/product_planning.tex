\title{Product Planning}

\begin{abstract}
The product we are making is called DuoDrive, and it is a racing game where people have to work together win. It is a game that is being built to have something to do whilst you are waiting.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
The product that we are making is a game. This is not a casual game, but a game were interaction with another player is vital for winning the game. But winning is not why we are making this game. We are making this game because we want that people can engage in a fun activity while waiting for someone or something.\\
The concept of the game is as follows:\\
It is essentially a race game, but the twist is that two people will control the car. One person will be in control of steering and the other person will be in control of the throttle. The game will be played on two different screens. The person that is in control of the steering has limited view, thus cannot completely see where he is going. The person can see how fast the car must go, this information needs to be passed over to the player who controls the throttle. This player can see where the steering player has to go and needs to inform the other player.\\
To get this idea to a final product we will need a proper planning. First of we will talk about the product itself, after that the product backlog is the subject. Third we will talk about the definition of done. At the and there is a glossary.
\section{Product}
\subsection{High-level product backlog}
Our game basically consists of two parts: The \gls{steering player} and the \gls{acceleration player}. The steering player has a limited view of the track and therefore has a hard time steering. In order to accomplish his successful steering this player has to cooperate with the acceleration player which has a complete overview of the track. However this player can only accelerate or decelerate. As both players control the same car they have to be connected in a network. \\\\
Translating the above to a high-level product backlog gives us the following items
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create different interfaces for both players
	\item Create control events for both players
	\item Glue both players with a network.
\end{itemize}
A backlog containing, in detail, all features that can be expected, along with their planning of being implemented is listed below in subsection: Roadmap
\subsection{Roadmap}
This section of the report will contain the features that we designed. We have divided these features according to the \gls{MoSCoW} model to give a brief overview of the features and their priority's. The features that must and should be implemented are planned into sprints, which sprint is stated between brackets.
\subsubsection{Must haves}
The following features are essential and will be implemented.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Race track and Car (Sprint 1)
	\item Network server to implement online player interaction (Sprint 2)
	\item Different controls for different roles (\gls{steering player} and \gls{acceleration player}) including different User Interfaces (Sprint 4)
	\item Road sprites (including tricking ones) (Sprint 1)
    \item Steering player must have minimal vision of the track (Sprint 1)
    \item Acceleration player is able to see the whole track (Sprint 3)
    \item Playable on android (Sprint 5)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Should haves}
The following features are not essential to a minimal game, but will definitely improve gameplay.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tag teams can match up (Sprint 6)  
    \item Random tracks to delete track learning factor (Sprint 5)
    \item Steering should be done with \gls{Gyroscope} (Sprint 7)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Could haves}
The following features will only be implemented if time allows us to do so.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{Ghosts} of other tag teams to see what position you are in 
    \item Match position during the game
    \item Several car sprites
    \item Track times according to random track length.
    \item Drop objects on track to harass other players.
    \item Cross-platform interaction.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Wont haves}
These features will not be implemented as they do not improve gameplay relative to the time they cost.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A second mode: ranked mode
\end{itemize}
The intended planning will be shown below in a brief overview.
\section{Product Backlog}
For this section, a number of user stories will be told in regards to: features, defects,  technical improvements and know-how acquisition. There will also be a section with the initial release plan.
\subsection{User stories of features}
As a player,\\
Who controls the wheels,\\
I can steer the car\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who controls the throttle,\\
I can determine the speed of the car\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who controls the steering,\\
I can see when the speed of car needs adjustment\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who controls the throttle,\\
I can see when the car needs steering\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who wants to start a game,\\
And there is no game available,\\
I can start a new game\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who wants to start a game,\\
And there is a game available,\\
I can join that game\\

\subsection{User stories of know-how acquisition}
As a player,\\
I know the controls of the game,\\
because it is explained to me at the beginning of the game,\\
trough onscreen explanation\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who drives too fast trough a mud section,\\
The car slows down,\\
For the next time I know I must go slow\\
\\
As a player,\\
Who sees an arrow on the ground pointing to the right,\\
I will go right, but the road does not,\\
For the next time I know no to trust the arrows

\subsection{Initial release plan}
For our project we will have some milestones.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item network implementation finished
\item gyroscope control
\item different controls for each player
\end{itemize}
These features will we see as milestones for out project. Also in this order.
The Minimal release features(MRF) per release are all the same. The MRFs consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item The release must have a track with a car, that has limited vision
\item It must also have network capabilities
\item The car must have seperate controls before we can release it
\end{itemize}
If those features are not done we cannot release the game.
\section{Definition of Done}
The last section of this report will explain in detail when the endproduct can be considered done. This section will particularly handle the DoD of a feature, sprint and release.
\subsection{Backlog Items}
Within the backlog an item is considered done, when all the checklist points below are true.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Code complete and approved by lead programmer
	\item Code satisfies coding standards
	\item Unit tests written and executed
	\item Integration system test passed
	\item Documented
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sprint}
A sprint is considered done, when all the checklist points below are true.
\begin{itemize}
	\item All sprint items considered done
	\item Application is tested globally, all unit tests pass
	\item Integration system test passed
	\item User tests passed
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Releases}
A release is considered done, when all the checklist points below are true.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The product should pass all unit tests
	\item Integration system test passed
	\item Interface looks like the product owner demanded.
	\item (End)user tests passed
	\item Code documented and satisfies coding standards.
\end{itemize}
Let it be clear that all of the above section cannot be done if the continues integration tests fail.\\
The main version of the product must apply to the sprint subsection of the definition of done. The other version does not have to apply to this. The moment the are merged into the main version, it is the main version, so they apply to they definition of done terms of the main version.
