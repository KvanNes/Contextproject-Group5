This is a racing game where you control the car with two players, 
one for the throttle and the other for steering.
This game is made in Unity, the free version.

Limitations of Unity
There are a few limitations found in Unity. One of them is code coverage.
If we wish to have code coverage in Unity, we need to purchase a very
expensive tool. Because this is a project that lasts only 3 months and it
is for our study, and because such a tool costs about €2000,- we did not 
necessary to buy such a tool.

Functions with lots of parameters
These functions are usually the RPC calls. With those calls you cannot 
give any objects with them. So you must give all of the data of that object
to the other players with only basic datastructers. Thats why these functions
have lots of parameters.
